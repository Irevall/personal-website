title: About me
text: I still have a lot to learn, but I'm doing my best to improve after each task.
  I take code reviews very seriously and try to understand and implement each suggestion.
  I don't have any strong preference between Front and Back end (or both), although I'm not nearly as efficient as
  Front end developer without some sort of design ready.
