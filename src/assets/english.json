      "text": "My interest in programming began a couple of years ago, after I've started using JavaScript add-ons for an online browser game and shortly I found myself trying to write my own. It made me more interested in IT so I went to professional technical school, EZN, which I completed in 2017. It also granted me \"Certificate of competence, an IT technician\". Unfortunately it only taught me the basics, so most of my knowledge I learnt myself."

My English is decent, I have a FCE on B2 level, while I'm not grammatically perfect, it's more than enough to understand documentation and handle communication. I'm best with JavaScript (and Node), that's what I use in most of my projects. Recently I picked up Vue, I also know SQL, obviously some HTML + CSS and basics of nginx."

I've even participated in couple amateur tournaments (with various success). As for movies I not only enjoy watching them but I am also interested in the logistics behind them. My favourite movie is probably The Grand Budapest Hotel, for its perfect mix of humor and action."
