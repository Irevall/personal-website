I have English certificate on B2 level, so I don't have any problems understanding documentation and handling communication. I'm best with JavaScript (and Node), I also use Vue. I'm able to create site structure (HTML + CSS), but it doesn't always show as I tend to put too much focus on Back-end (or get distracted by new projects). I know SQL (sqlite), basics of Webpack and nginx. Currently I'm learning SASS and React."

My favourite movie is probably The Grand Budapest Hotel, for its perfect mix of humor and action."
